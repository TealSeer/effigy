  - qol: Your own messages in blood cult communion, abductor/xenomorph/changeling

      to kick-tier damage against standing grappled targets - even if they're not
      doing the grappling.
  - balance: Strong-Arm implant users also benefit from the training of punching grappled
      people as well - as a treat, horizontal targets slam into the ground and break
      tiling for no additional damage, but a very visible sign of "oh god someone
      got pasted here".
